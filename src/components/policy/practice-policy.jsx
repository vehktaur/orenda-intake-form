              providers, you must provide credit card information that will be

            APPOINTMENT LENGTH: Please select the appropriate length of
            appointment you require based on your personal needs. Should you
            require additional time at the end of your session, your provider
            will try to accommodate you if their schedule allows, but you will
            be charged for the additional time in accordance with our service
            pricing.
          </p>
          <p>
            APPOINTMENT INTERVALS: Your provider will discuss the appropriate
            appointment interval for your unique and individual needs. Should
            you require psychiatric medication management, you may be required
            to see your provider at least once per month for ongoing medication
            management.
          </p>
          <p>
            SESSION RECORDING: Sessions may be recorded (audio and/or video)
            only with the express consent of both provider and patient. Consent
            must be captured in the recording.
          </p>

          <p>
            Orenda Psychiatry providers do not participate in any Medicaid
            plans. If you are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, you
            will be considered out of network for Medicaid and should find
            another provider who accepts Medicaid.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for providing updated insurance information to
            Orenda Psychiatry should your plan change. You’ll also be
            responsible for the fees associated with the service rendered if
            your insurance coverage terminates. Private pay fee schedule will be
            provided upon request.
          </p>
          <p>
            FORMS & DOCUMENTS: For your initial visit and consultation, you will
            be required to complete a package of online intake forms and
            consents. Completion of intake forms is required prior the
            appointment. If you do not see your provider for a period of 90 days
            or longer, you may be required to book a new initial consultation
            appointment and/or update your initial intake forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            ACCOMMODATION LETTERS & FORMS: If you require a form asking for
            accommodation at work or school, or a leave of absence or any kind,
            Orenda Psychiatry providers reserve the right to refuse such forms
            if they disagree with the request due to their clinical findings. If
            they provider is open to filling out the forms after a minimum
            number of appointments (to be determined by your provider), a
            separate appointment must be booked for completing the letter or
            form in its entirety.
          </p>
          <p>
            CANCELLATIONS & RE-SCHEDULING: Please remember to cancel or
            reschedule at least 24 hours prior to your appointment to avoid a
            $100 fee. This is necessary because a time commitment is made to you
            and is held exclusively for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            UNIVERSITY AFFILIATIONS AND INTERNS Orenda psychiatry is an approved
            clinical site for multiple Massachusetts and New York based
            universities. In our commitment to nursing education and affiliated
            universities, our providers often supervise intern PMHNPs who are
            pursuing graduate work and are in process of earning their
            psychiatric nurse practitioner certificates. Therefore, there may
            come a time that you will have contact with or will work directly
            with student intern PMHNPs. You reserve the right to request to not
            work with a student/intern. Orenda Psychiatry will do its best to
            meet your request depending on provider availability.
          </p>
          <p>
            LATE & NO-SHOWS: If you are late for a session, we may only be able
            to see you for the time remaining in your appointment or may not be
            able to accommodate you at all depending on your tardiness, your
            session length, and our commitment to other clients. In any case, if
            you are late or no-show to appointments, you will be charged the
            full cost of the entire scheduled appointment.
          </p>
          <p>
            TELEPHONE & TEXT ACCESSIBILITY BETWEEN APPOINTMENTS: You may contact
            Orenda Psychiatry by phone, email or text message and we will do our
            best to convey your message as soon as possible to your provider. If
            you require emergency attention, call 911 or seek emergency care.
          </p>
          <p>
            PRESCRIPTION REFILLS: Orenda Psychiatry providers do not respond to
            pharmacy refill requests. Should you require a refill, please
            contact Orenda Psychiatry directly. It is expected that you and your
            provider meet consistently and regularly in order for your
            prescriber to provide medication management. Orenda Psychiatry
            providers will not provide early refills on controlled substances.
            Additionally, controlled substances require that the client be
            assessed prior to each refill. Please note that our providers are
            highly experienced and qualified to offer expert opinions on your
            case. As such, they are not obligated to prescribe a specific
            medication if they believe it is unnecessary or potentially harmful,
            based on their professional judgment and expertise.
          </p>
          <p>
            SOCIAL MEDIA AND TELECOMMUNICATION: Due to the importance of your
            confidentiality and the importance of minimizing dual relationships,
            Orenda Psychiatry providers do not accept friend or contact requests
            from current or former clients on their personal social networking
            sites (Facebook, Instagram, etc).
          </p>
          <p>
            MINORS: If you are a minor, your parents may be legally entitled to
            some information about your therapy. Your provider will discuss with
            you and your parents what information is appropriate for them to
            receive and which issues are more appropriately kept confidential.
          </p>
          <p>
            TERMINATION: Ending relationships can be difficult. Therefore, it is
            important to have a termination process in order to achieve some
            closure. The appropriate length of the termination depends on the
            length and intensity of the treatment. Your provider may terminate
            treatment after appropriate discussion with you and a termination
            process if they determine that the psychotherapy is not being
            effectively used or if you are in default on payment. Orenda
            Psychiatry will not terminate the therapeutic relationship without
            first discussing and exploring the reasons and purpose of
            terminating. Should you fail to schedule an appointment within 90
            days, unless other arrangements have been made in advance, for legal
            and ethical reasons, we must consider the professional relationship
            discontinued.

            BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Our psychiatric team is composed of
            psychiatric mental health professionals. We are a telemedicine
            psychiatry practice and are required by law to perform an assessment
            prior to medications being prescribed. We require a video
            appointment in order to meet our legal requirement. We are not a
            pharmacy and we do not send prescriptions outside of the U.S..
          </p>

          <p>
            EMERGENCIES: I understand that in the event of an emergency, I
            should dial 911 or go to the nearest emergency department. I
            understand that Orenda Psychiatry is not to be used in the event of
            a medical or psychiatric emergency.
          </p>

          <h3>WHEN DUTY OF CARE BEGINS</h3>
          <ul className='sublist-disc'>
            <li>
              I understand that my provider will take responsibility for my care
              after I have completed all of the required health questions and
              forms, had an initial evaluation, and subsequently determined to
              be a good candidate for psychiatric services with the provider who
              performs my initial assessment. I understand that the duty of care
              does not begin at the point of me completing intake questions,
              scheduling an appointment, making payment or starting a scheduled
              session. It begins when the provider accepts the duty of care.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that the provider has the right to refuse
              responsibility for my care if they determine that I am not a good
              candidate for this service.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that sending a message through the website or the
              secure messaging system does not establish a patient-provider
              relationship.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that there may be a delay or number of days before my
              request for treatment or my messages are viewed.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that content found on the website is not medical or
              psychiatric advice.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>RISKS AND BENEFITS OF USING OUR TELEPSYCHIATRY SERVICE</h3>
          <ul className='sublist-disc'>
            <li>
              I understand that currently video conferencing technology will be
              used and that I may not have the opportunity to meet with my
              provider in person at their location.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that potential benefits of telehealth communication
              include easier access to care and the convenience of meeting from
              a location of my choosing.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that there are potential risks to telehealth,
              including interruptions, technical difficulties and unauthorized
              access. I understand that I or my provider can end the
              consult/visit if it is felt that the connection is not adequate.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that I may not have an in-person consultation or an
              in person physical exam. This might prevent the identification of
              a medical or psychiatric condition that needs further
              investigation or immediate treatment.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that my provider may require me to attend an
              in-person appointment with them, another Orenda provider, or my
              primary care physician at some point during my treatment.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that if I have any questions relating to my care that
              aren’t urgent, I can contact my provider through the Orenda
              support team’s secure messaging system. I understand that my
              messages may not be viewed or responded to for several days.
            </li>
            <li>
              To maintain confidentiality, I will not share my telehealth
              appointment link with anyone unauthorized to attend the
              appointment.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>IMPORTANCE OF FULLY AND TRUTHFULLY ANSWERING ALL QUESTIONS</h3>
          <ul className='sublist-disc'>
            <li>
              I understand that the information I provide will be used to
              determine my treatment. I understand that the safety and
              appropriateness of treatment prescribed will rely on the accuracy
              of information I share with my provider.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that my provider will consider information I share to
              be true and complete, including my age, gender, sex, and all
              answers to my health questions. I agree to provide a copy of a
              federally issued photo identification card or passport as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that if I provide information that is not true,
              complete, or accurate, that I will be at greater risk for adverse
              events, or for treatment that is not safe, necessary, or
              effective. I understand that even if I provide information that is
              true and complete, there are still risks to treatment.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>RISKS OF PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION</h3>
          <ul className='sublist-disc'>
            <li>
              I understand that the information I provide will be used to
              determine my treatment. I understand that the safety and
              appropriateness of treatment prescribed will rely on the accuracy
              of information I share with my provider.I understand that all
              medications that may be prescribed or recommended by my provider,
              including prescriptions, over the counter medications, and herbal
              supplements can cause serious side effects, adverse events, severe
              allergic reaction, permanent disability, and death.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that it is my responsibility to make an informed
              decision and whether to agree to a treatment plan that is proposed
              by my provider. I understand that by accepting a treatment plan it
              is my responsibility to weigh the benefits against the risks of
              taking prescribed medication, using alternative treatment, and the
              option of not seeking treatment.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand the importance of reading the manufacturer’s print
              and warnings that come with medicines before taking.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that adverse events can be caused by a number of
              things, such as an allergic reaction, side effects, or
              interactions with another medication that I take. I understand
              that adverse events can also be caused by combining prescribed
              medication with supplements, herbs, recreational drugs, tobacco,
              and alcohol.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that if I am a threat to myself or others, I should
              not use Orenda Psychiatry and instead, I should call 911 or
              contact the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that the prescription medicine classes selective
              serotonin inhibitors (SSRIs), norepinephrine serotonin re-uptake
              inhibitors (SNRI) and atypical antidepressant (bupropion) are FDA
              approved for depression and/or anxiety and are prescribed in that
              manner. I understand that taking these types of medicines may
              cause sexual dysfunction (problems with orgasm, ejaculation,
              and/or erectile dysfunction), and also potentially
              life-threatening side effects, the risk of suicidal thoughts and
              behavior and can cause a severe allergic reaction that can lead to
              disability and even death.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that abruptly stopping any of the treatments may
              cause symptoms including but not limited to anxiety, irritability,
              agitation, dizziness, nausea and sensory disturbances such as the
              feeling of having an electric shock.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that as part of treatment I am required to provide an
              emergency contact person as well as ensuring any weapons at home
              are both unloaded and locked. I understand as part of treatment
              that my provider may require me to abstain from any alcohol or
              substance use including but not limited to marijuana, cocaine, and
              stimulants. I understand that if I am unable to satisfy these
              terms of treatment, I may not be an appropriate candidate for this
              service and may be discharged from Orenda Psychiatry. I understand
              that my provider has the right to terminate treatment at any time.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that there are alternatives to the prescription-only
              medicines and my provider may incorporate psychotherapy into
              treatment. I understand that I may be required to participate in
              psychotherapy with my provider in order for my provider to
              prescribe medication.
            </li>

          <h3>RISKS TO ELECTRONIC HEALTH INFORMATION</h3>
          <ul className='list-disc'>
            <li>
              I understand that although Orenda Psychiatry implements
              administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect my
              health information, Orenda Psychiatry cannot guarantee the privacy
              and confidentiality of my health information.

          <h3>RISKS AND BENEFITS TO PSYCHOTHERAPY</h3>
          <ul className='list-disc'>
            <li>
              I understand that the outcome of my treatment depends largely on
              my willingness to engage in this process, which may, at times,
              result in considerable discomfort. I understand that remembering
              unpleasant events and becoming aware of feelings attached to those
              events can bring on strong feelings of anger, depression, anxiety,

          <p>
            I understand that as part of my healthcare at Orenda Psychiatry, it
            is necessary to obtain a comprehensive view of my medication history
            to provide the best possible care. This includes prescription
            medications, over-the-counter drugs, and dietary supplements that I
            have taken or am currently taking.
          </p>

          <p>
            I acknowledge that Orenda Psychiatry may access my medical and
            prescription records through an Electronic Health Record (EHR)
            system connected to pharmacy networks. This access includes
            information on prescribed medications, dosages, and refill history.
