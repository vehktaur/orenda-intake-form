        <p>
          APPOINTMENT LENGTH Please select the appropriate length of appointment
          you require based on your personal needs. Should you require
          additional time at the end of your session, your provider will try to
          accommodate you if their schedule allows, but you will be charged for
          the additional time in accordance with our service pricing.
        </p>
        <p>
          APPOINTMENT INTERVALS Your provider will discuss the appropriate
          appointment interval for your unique and individual needs. Should you
          require psychiatric medication management, you are required to see
          your provider at least once per month for ongoing medication
          management.
        </p>

        <p>
          FORMS & DOCUMENTS For your initial visit and consultation, you will be
          required to complete a package of online intake forms and consents.
          Completion of intake forms is required 48 hours in advance of your
          appointment time. If you do not see your provider for a period of 90
          days or longer, you will be required to book a new initial
          consultation appointment and complete all your initial intake forms
          again. In this event, there is no guarantee that you will be seen by
          your original provider or any other Orenda Psychiatry Provider. You
          may be placed on a wait list depending on availability.
        </p>
        <p>
          ACCOMMODATION LETTERS & FORMS If you require a form asking for
          accommodation at work, school, or leave of absence or any kind, Orenda
          Psychiatry providers reserve the right to refuse such forms if they
          disagree with the request due to their clinical findings. If they
          provider is open to filling out the forms an appointment time must be
          booked appropriate for completing the letter or form in its entirety.
        </p>
        <p>
          CANCELLATIONS & RE-SCHEDULING Please remember to cancel or reschedule
          at least 24 hours in advance. You will be charged a $100 fee for a
          cancellation or re-scheduling within 24 hours of your appointment
          time. This is necessary because a time commitment is made to you and
          is held exclusively for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          UNIVERSITY AFFILIATIONS AND INTERNS Orenda psychiatry is an approved
          clinical site for multiple Massachusetts and New York based
          universities. In our commitment to nursing education and affiliated
          universities, our providers often supervise intern PMHNPs who are
          pursuing graduate work and are in process of earning their psychiatric
          nurse practitioner certificates. Therefore, there may come a time that
          you will have contact with or will work directly with student intern
          PMHNPs. You reserve the right to request to not work with a
          student/intern. Orenda Psychiatry will do its best to meet your
          request depending on provider availability.
        </p>
        <p>
          LATE & NO-SHOWS If you are late for a session, we may only be able to
          see you for the time remaining in your appointment or may not be able
          to accommodate you at all depending on your tardiness, your session
          length, and our commitment to other clients. In any case, if you are
          late or no-show to appointments, you will be charged the full cost of
          the entire scheduled appointment.
        </p>
        <p>
          TELEPHONE & TEXT ACCESSIBILITY BETWEEN APPOINTMENTS You may contact
          Orenda Psychiatry by phone, email or text message. You and your
          provider are also expected to communicate directly regarding your
          care. You may contact your provider via phone, text, or email should
          you have any questions or concerns pertaining to your treatment. Your
          provider may not answer immediately and if you need urgent assistance
          we encourage you to also contact our main office. If you require
          emergency attention, call 911 or attend a local emergency room.
        </p>
        <p>
          PRESCRIPTION REFILLS Orenda Psychiatry providers do not respond to
          pharmacy refill requests. It is up to you to contact your provider
          when you require a refill on your medications. It is expected that you
          and your provider meet consistently and regularly in order for your
          prescriber to provide medication management. Orenda Psychiatry
          providers will not provide early refills on controlled substances.
          Additionally, controlled substances require that the client be
          assessed at each refill. Please note that our providers are highly
          experienced and qualified to offer expert opinions on your case. As
          such, they are not obligated to prescribe a specific medication if
          they believe it is unnecessary or potentially harmful, based on their
          professional judgment and expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          SOCIAL MEDIA AND TELECOMMUNICATION Due to the importance of your
          confidentiality and the importance of minimizing dual relationships,
          Orenda Psychiatry providers do not accept friend or contact requests
          from current or former clients on their personal social networking
          sites (Facebook, Instagram, etc). We believe that adding clients as
          friends or contacts on these sites can compromise your confidentiality
          and our respective privacy. It may also blur the boundaries of the
          therapeutic relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          MINORS If you are a minor, your parents may be legally entitled to
          some information about your therapy. Your provider will discuss with
          you and your parents what information is appropriate for them to
          receive and which issues are more appropriately kept confidential.
        </p>
        <p>
          TERMINATION Ending relationships can be difficult. Therefore, it is
          important to have a termination process in order to achieve some
          closure. The appropriate length of the termination depends on the
          length and intensity of the treatment. Your provider may terminate
          treatment after appropriate discussion with you and a termination
          process if they determine that the psychotherapy is not being
          effectively used or if you are in default on payment. Orenda
          Psychiatry will not terminate the therapeutic relationship without
          first discussing and exploring the reasons and purpose of terminating.
          If therapy is terminated for any reason or you request another
          provider, you may request another provider by contacting our front
          office. Should you fail to schedule an appointment within 90 days,
          unless other arrangements have been made in advance, for legal and
          ethical reasons, we must consider the professional relationship
          discontinued.

          BACKGROUND INFORMATION Our psychiatric team is composed of psychiatric
          mental health professionals. We are a telemedicine psychiatry practice
          and are required by law to preform an assessment prior to medications
          being prescribed. We require a video appointment in order to meet our
          legal requirement. We are not a pharmacy and we do not send
          prescriptions outside of the U.S.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          EMERGENCIES I understand that in the event of an emergency, I should
          dial 911 or go to the nearest emergency department. I understand that
          Orenda Psychiatry is not to be used in the event of a medical or
          psychiatric emergency.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHEN DUTY OF CARE BEGINS I understand that my provider will take
          responsibility for my care after I have completed all of the required
          health questions and forms, had an initial evaluation, and
          subsequently determined to be a good candidate for psychiatric
          services with the provider who performs my initial assessment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that the duty of care does not begin at the point of me
          completing intake questions, scheduling an appointment, making payment
          or starting a scheduled session. It begins when the provider accepts
          the duty of care.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that the provider has the right to refuse responsibility
          for my care if they determine that I am not a good candidate for this
          service.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that duty of care is not established by making a request
          for treatment, scheduling an appointment, making a payment, or
          starting a video session.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that sending a message through the website or the secure
          messaging system does not establish a patient-provider relationship.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that there may be a delay or number of days before my
          request for treatment or my messages are viewed.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that content found on the website is not medical or
          psychiatric advice.

        <p>RISKS AND BENEFITS OF USING OUR TELE-PSYCHIATRY SERVICE</p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that currently video conferencing technology will be used
          and that I will not have the opportunity to meet with my provider in
          person at their location.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that potential benefits of Telehealth communication
          include easier access to care and the convenience of meeting from a
          location of my choosing.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that there are potential risks to tele-health, including
          interruptions, technical difficulties and unauthorized access.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that I or my provider can end the consult/visit if it is
          felt that the connection is not adequate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that I won’t have an in person consultation or an in
          person physical exam. This might prevent the identification of a
          medical or psychiatric condition that needs further investigation or
          immediate treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that my provider may require me to attend an in-person
          appointment with them, another Orenda provider, or my primary care
          physician at some point during my treatment.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that if I have any questions relating to my care that
          aren’t urgent, I can message my provider through the secure messaging
          system or contact them by email or phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that my messages may not be viewed or responded to for
          several days. To maintain confidentiality, I will not share my
          tele-health appointment link with anyone unauthorized to attend the
          appointment.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>IMPORTANCE OF FULLY AND TRUTHFULLY ANSWERING ALL QUESTIONS</p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that the information I provide will be used to determine
          my treatment.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that the safety and appropriateness of treatment
          prescribed will rely on the accuracy of information I share with my
          provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that my provider will consider information I share to be
          true and complete, including my age, gender, sex, and all answers to
          my health questions. I agree to provide a copy of a federally issued
          photo identification card or passport.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that if I provide information that is not true, complete,
          or accurate, that I will be at greater risk for adverse events, or for
          treatment that is not safe, necessary, or effective. I understand that
          even if I provide information that is true and complete, there are
          still risks to treatment.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>RISKS OF PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION</p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that all medications that may be prescribed or
          recommended by my provider, including prescriptions, over the counter
          medications, and herbal supplements can cause serious side effects,
          adverse events, severe allergic reaction, permanent disability, and
          death.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that it is my responsibility to make an informed decision
          and whether to agree to a treatment plan that is proposed by my
          provider. I understand that by accepting a treatment plan it is my
          responsibility to weigh the benefits against the risks of taking
          prescribed medication, using alternative treatment, and the option of
          not seeking treatment.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand the importance of reading the manufacture’s print and
          warnings that come with the medicine before taking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that adverse events can be caused by a number of things,
          such as an allergic reaction, side effects, or interactions with
          another medication that I take. I understand that adverse events can
          also be caused by combining prescribed medication with supplements,
          herbs, recreational drugs, tobacco, and alcohol.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that if I am a threat to myself or others, I should not
          use Orenda Psychiatry and instead, I should call 911 or contact the
          National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that the prescription medicine classes selective
          serotonin inhibitors (SSRIs), norepinephrine serotonin re-uptake
          inhibitors (SNRI) and atypical antidepressant (bupropion) are FDA
          approved for depression and/or anxiety and are prescribed in that
          manner. I understand that taking these types of medicines may cause
          sexual dysfunction (problems with orgasm, ejaculation, and/or erectile
          dysfunction), and also potentially life-threatening side effects, the
          risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and can cause a severe allergic
          reaction that can lead to disability and even death.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that abruptly stopping any of the treatments may cause
          symptoms including but not limited to anxiety, irritability,
          agitation, dizziness, nausea and sensory disturbances such as the
          feeling of having an electric shock.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that as part of treatment I am required to provide an
          emergency contact person as well as ensuring any weapons at home are
          both unloaded and locked. I understand as part of treatment that my
          provider may require me to abstain from any alcohol or substance use
          including but not limited to marijuana, cocaine, and stimulants. I
          understand that if I am unable to satisfy these terms of treatment, I
          may not be an appropriate candidate for this service and may be
          discharged from Orenda Psychiatry. I understand that my provider has
          the right to terminate treatment at any time.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that there are alternatives to the prescription-only
          medicines and my provider may incorporate psychotherapy into
          treatment. I understand that I may be required to participate in
          psychotherapy with my provider in order for my provider to prescribe
          medication.
        </p>
        <p>RISKS TO ELECTRONIC HEALTH INFORMATION</p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that although Orenda Psychiatry implements
          administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect my
          health information, Orenda Psychiatry cannot guarantee the privacy and
          confidentiality of my health information.
        </p>
        <p>RISKS AND BENEFITS TO PSYCHOTHERAPY</p>{' '}
        <p>
          I understand that the outcome of my treatment depends largely on my
          willingness to engage in this process, which may, at times, result in
          considerable discomfort. I understand that remembering unpleasant
          events and becoming aware of feelings attached to those events can
          bring on strong feelings of anger, depression, anxiety, etc. I
          understand that there are no miracle cures and that there is no
          promise that my behavior or circumstance will change.

        <p>
          I understand that as part of my healthcare at Orenda Psychiatry, it is
          necessary to obtain a comprehensive view of my medication history to
          provide the best possible care. This includes prescription
          medications, over-the-counter drugs, and dietary supplements that I
          have taken or am currently taking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I acknowledge that Orenda Psychiatry may access my medical and
          prescription records through an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system
          connected to pharmacy networks. This access includes information on
          prescribed medications, dosages, and refill history.
